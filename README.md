# Easily copy and paste whole code with structure to ChatGPT

i was making an online multiplayer game using chat gpt mainly, i kept having to give it my whole code files and the file structure i am using to ask it for advice on how to refactor my code or what was going wrong potentially

this can be good for small softwares like that or even if u have a big file structure with allot of files and allot of lines of codes then still u can just copy individual files

this is amazing

it lets u copy individual fiels and all fliesssses

i made the exe file using this command: `pyinstaller --onefile file_structure.py`
